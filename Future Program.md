# Future Programs

## We will be extremely focusing on Technical Guidance.

### Open Source
  - Learn about Git and GitHub and start your journey of Open Source Contribution. Open Source can help you to get many opportunities in Tech.


### Learning Resources
  - We use the Telegram channel to share free learning resources and opportunities in tech. We believe that a student should never have to pay for their learning until required. We try our best to help students.


### Workshops/Webinar/Bootcamps
  - We make sure to provide technical guidance by connecting with mentors and students who are doing well in their careers. We wish to become a bridge between the students and mentors and provide them the guidance or roadmap that the mentors followed to understand the path. 


### Student Programs
  - Networking and Personal Branding is very important for a student to show his uniqueness to different students. We believe that Student Programs are the best way to showcase your skills and learn in public. We will guide students to join their favorite communities and how they can get ready to get accepted into these programs.
